#+TITLE: NumberRace: specifications

* Cognitive background

- quantity representations
- numerical comparison
- varying levels of numerical distance
- adapt to the current level of the child's quantity representation
- association between representations of number and space
- reinforce core number sense and the link between number sense and
  its symbolic representation
- increase ability for very basic addition and subtraction facts
- scaffolding procedure to rely increasingly on symbolic representation
- repeated association feature

From the conclusion : "The design of the software incorporated four
major principles: Enhancing number sense, cementing links between
symbolic and non-symbolic representations of number, conceptualiz- ing
and automatizing arithmetic, and maximizing moti- vation."

* User Interface

Two main screens :

1. The comparison screen for numerical comparison task
   - possibly add or subtract
   - possibly with a timer
   - format can be non-symbolic (gold pieces) or symbolic-written
     (digit) or symbolic-verbal (spoken words) or a combination
   - feedback: (1) all three formats together for the choice and (2)
     whether the player wins or loses

2. The board screen
   - move by the chosen number (win or lose)
     - at one time
     - if 4 pieces, move by x then y [then z] (x+y[+z]=4)
     - avoid hazards [how many hazards?]
     - if go on hazard, go backward [how many steps? one]
     - if arrive at the end, collect a reward

Addition = a sum, up to 9
Subtraction = a subtraction, result up to 8

* Adaptative learning

** A 3-dimensions learning space

- numerical distance :: see Weber ratio

- speed :: increasingly short deadline, when there is a deadline

- conceptual complexity :: teaches about number symbols and elementary
     arithmetic.  Difficulty is increased in two [three] ways:

  - decreasing the ratio non-symbolic/symbolic information
  - introducing addition and subtraction at the higher level
  - [adding hazards to the board]

The learning space is a cube, with probabilities of success attached
at each point - for example, the [0.1,0.1,0.1] point in the cube as a
.3 probability of success = an operational definition of the current
knowledge of the child.

** Adaptative algorithme

"The task of this algorithm is to estimate what the knowledge space
looks like for each child, and to present children with problems on
which the child will perform well most but not all of the time,
i.e. problems in their "zone of proximal learning".

*** Core adaptative algorithm

 - the algo calculates the performance for the 20 last turns

 - suggest a problem at the difficulty level required to maintain a 75%
   success performance

* Problems

- for tested children (from 7 to 9), the first levels were to easy,
  and the software took too long to adapt to an interesting level.

- some children bored after 10 hours of use.
  - due to initial slowness (see above)
  - insufficient variation in the game
  - slowness of game play
  - children had won all of the rewards and characters available

* Data

- Comparing numbers from 1 to 9

** Assets

- images
- sounds
